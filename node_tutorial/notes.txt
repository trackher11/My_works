This is my notes sections!
node -v
npm -v

......
npm init (this creates a package.json file which contains the package that is used in the project).

......
npm i express (this creates a express app with all the node modules).

......
npm i --save-dev nodemon (This is used to create a dev dependency which is used only during development)

......
npm uninstall nodemon (This is use to remove the dependency)

......
package.json contains the dependency
package-local.json contains the dependency tree which contains the dependencies of all the node modules.

......
To export anything from one file to another for ex an object use export methods 
ex: "module.exports = objectName;"

To import the object into another file use require methods 
ex: "const variable_name = require("./file_name.js");"

......
Any node function returns the object in the form of a function
ex function((exports,require,module,__filename,__dirname: ", __dirname)){
   console.log("exports: ", exports,"\n require: ", require,"\n module: ", module,"\n __filename: ", __filename,"\n __dirname: ", __dirname);
}
