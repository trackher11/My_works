This is my notes sections!
node -v
npm -v

......
npm init (this creates a package.json file which contains the package that is used in the project).

......
npm i express (this creates a express app with all the node modules).

......
npm i --save-dev nodemon (This is used to create a dev dependency which is used only during development)
npm install -g nodemon (to install globally)

......
npm uninstall nodemon (This is use to remove the dependency)

......
package.json contains the dependency
package-local.json contains the dependency tree which contains the dependencies of all the node modules.

......
To export anything from one file to another for ex an object use export methods 
ex: "module.exports = objectName;"

To import the object or a common function into another file use require methods 
ex: "const variable_name = require("./file_name.js");"

......
Any node function returns the object in the form of a function
ex function((exports,require,module,__filename,__dirname: ", __dirname)){
   console.log("exports: ", exports,"\n require: ", require,"\n module: ", module,"\n __filename: ", __filename,"\n __dirname: ", __dirname);
}

.......
To export multiple functions use it like this:
export function simple() {
  console.log("this is a function");
}
export function simple2() {
  console.log("this is function2");
}

and to import the same:
import { simple, simple2 } from "./function_export.js";
simple()
simple2()

.........
To import all modules at once:
import * as all from "./function_export.js";
all.simple();
all.simple2();

.........
EventEmitter is used to create events and trigger it as and when needed.
setTimeout function is used to create a delay.


.........
Http module is used to load a server.

.......
express is a easier way to create applications.
