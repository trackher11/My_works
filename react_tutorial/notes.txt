//using this command to creat a react app
npx create-react-app my-app
npx create-react-app . // this is to create in the root folder

//use "npm start" after the folder all the files is installed

// two main folders here are "public" and "src" to take under consideration
->The "index.html" in the public folder ris the main page which is getting rendered
->there is a "<div id="root"></div>" in the body section, here is the place where all the content of the website is dynamically loaded
-> the "index.js" file in the src folder is the place where the main content starts gettin populated
-> all the contents are pushed using the "app.js" file
-> make all your changes to app.js file to see the changes reflected

// app.js is basically a component, it is a function which returns a "JSX"
-> JSX ex = function app(){
    return(
        <div> all content</div>
    )
}
-> JSX is almost html return with js
-> cetain reserved words such as class and for is replaced bu className and htmlfor
-> JSX can return only one element like one div above
-> if it has to return more than one then use the below ex
    JSX ex = function app(){
    return(
        <>
        <h1>hello</h1>
        <div> all content</div>
        </>
    )
}

//Babel complies JSX 

................................................................
// to export a function we have two methods
-> export by defualt ex: 
let a = "abc", b = "xyz";
export default a;
->if we want to explicitly export something then we need to send it in curly braces
export{a};
export{b};

..............................................  
// "Props" -> this is how the value is getting passed to the JSX components
ex: export default function Navbar(props) {
  return (<a className="navbar-brand" href="/">
          {props.title}
        </a>)
        }
Here the props is gettings passed from where it is being called
ex: <Navbar title="TextUtils"  />

//if the value type of the props has to be predifined then it is done as below
//string makes title as stringtype, isRequired makes it madatory

ex->
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
Navbar.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  aboutText: PropTypes.string,
};

// this is how the default props is getting passed
Navbar.defaultProps = {
  title: "default title",
  aboutText: "default about us",
};

................................................................
// Use State
this is one of the hooks used in React to edit the State
ex -> const [text, setText] = useState("Enter text here");
here text is the vaiable which is assigned the value "Enter text here"
to edit this varible we should use the function setText
ex -> setText("new val")

// used an "onClick" function to change the value of this "text" on the click of the button
// wherever the value of "text" is being changed we should use an "onChange" function 
   The "onChange" function creates an event which can be handled as below
   ex -> const handleOnChange = (event) => {
    setText(event.target.value);
  };
